    <h2 class="green">Soccer</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Soccer is one of the biggest sports in the world and the most watched in
      the world. I started soccer at a young age and am still playing and
      enjoying it to this day. I now play for Edmonton Scottish Soccer club and
      have played in the highest level of soccer here in Edmonton.

      and relaxing. My favourite things to draw were:
